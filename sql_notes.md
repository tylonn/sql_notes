# SQL Notes
In these notes, we are going to describe the basics of SQL using a "Hands On" approach, based on the [CS50â€™s Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2024/) course. The idea is to create an intuitive and easy-to-follow tutorial covering the most used parts of the language. It also serves as a mean to record ideas and techniques that are useful for people starting with data analysis and programming.  
To follow this material, readers should ideally be familiar with the basics of data analysis, though it is not strictly necessary.
